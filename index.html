        <h3> Right to live in dignity and decency: <span>The right to live in dignity, devoid of coercion, violence, and discrimination, belongs to every woman. Laws are very sensitive towards women’s rights and dignity. Sexual harassment (Section 354A), assault with the intent to disrobe her (Section 354B), voyeurism (Section 354C), stalking (Section 354D), and the like, are all crimes punishable under the Indian Penal Code (IPC).</span> </h3>
        <h3> Right against domestic violence: <span> Women who live in households like mothers or sisters are protected under Section 498A of the IPC from domestic abuse (including verbal, economic, emotional, and sexual) perpetrated by their husbands, male live-in partners, or relatives. As punishment, the accused will be sentenced to an indeterminate period of imprisonment, which may extend to three years, and will also have to pay a fine.</span> </h3>
        <h3> Right against workplace harassment :<span> Females are entitled to file a complaint against any kind of sexual harassment at their workplace under the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013. The Act permits her to make a complaint in writing to an Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) at a branch office within 3 months of the incident.</span>  </h3>
        <h3>  Right to privacy while recording the statement: <span> A woman who has been raped may record her statement before the district magistrate during a trial, as specified in Section 164 of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1973. No other witnesses must be in attendance while the statement is being recorded. The statement may also be recorded with only one police officer and a female constable in a convenient location that does not cause confusion or provide any possibility of a fourth person hearing the statement. Maintaining the privacy of the woman is a legal requirement for the police. While narrating the incident, the person should be comfortable and not under stress in any way.</span>  </h3>
